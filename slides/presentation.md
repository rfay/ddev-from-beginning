# 🧱 DDEV from the Beginning

Welcome! Let’s explore how **DDEV** can transform your local development workflow.✨


---

## 💻 Why Local Development? 

Let’s see why local is better! 🏡

- We work on separate environments (usually our local computers) 🖥️  
- Changes made for one issue/bug/feature affect only the developer working on them  
- Live and staging environments are affected predictably and when desired  
- Experimentation is easy and free ✨  

---

## 🚀 Why Use DDEV?

Here’s why **DDEV** is a game changer! 🐳

- Simple **Docker-based** local dev environment ✅  
- Supports multiple CMS and frameworks  
- Easy setup and configuration  
- Consistent environments across teams 🤝  

---

## 🖥️ System Requirements

What you’ll need to get started ⚙️

- **macOS**, **Linux**, **Windows WSL2** or traditional Windows are all supported  
- Any recent machine will do the job (8GB RAM recommended)  
- A **Docker provider** is required (e.g., Docker Desktop, Docker Engine, or other compatible Docker environments).  
  - See [DDEV Docker Providers](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/install/#docker-provider) for details.
